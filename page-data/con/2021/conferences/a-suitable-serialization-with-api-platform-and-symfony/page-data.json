Both of them are providing several technical solutions about object serialization. Groups, ContextBuilders, Serializers, DataTransformers, DTOs, Access controls... <strong>So many available tools that are addressing specific needs</strong>. Some of them are easy to implement, others are powerful. But, how to choose the adapted technical solution according to its needs?</p>\n<p>During this talk, we will cover some technical solutions and we will focus on the needs they try to address in order to use them wisely.</p>","type":"conference","speakers":"-mathias","track":"FR","start":"","end":"","short":"How to choose the adapted technical solution according to your serialization needs.","title":"A suitable serialization with API Platform and Symfony"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2622028926","2760183193"]}
